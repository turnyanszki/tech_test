# Ukio's coding test

Welcome! First of all, thanks for your interest in being part of Ukio's mission. Here you'll find all the instructions to set up the environment and the requisites for the exercise. 

## Elixir

If you're using `asdf`, you should be ready as we've defined the required version in the `.tool-versions` file. If it's not your case, you need Elixir >=v1.14; you can find [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) instructions to install it.

Once installed, you need to run the following commands.

1. > docker-compose up -d
2. > mix setup

You should already have the project up and running. You could run the tests to check if everything is working as expected

> mix test


## Coding test
After putting our first API MVP online, we're ready to face a second iteration, and here is where we need your help. Right now, our API is capable of handling simple bookings, but we're expanding, and we want to be able to rent our apartments in more cities. Let's go into detail to our models, API, and requirements for those new markets

### Models
1. Apartments:
    * ID
    * Name
    * Address
    * Zip code
    * Monthly price
    * Square meters
	* Market


2. Bookings
    * ID
    * Check-in
    * Check-out
    * Apartment_id
    * Monthly rent

### API
1. GET /api/apartments
  > Return the lists of apartments with all the fields we have in the model
2. POST /api/bookings
  > Create a new booking. For its creation, we need the following body
  ```JSON
    {
      booking: 
      {
        check_in: date
        check_out: date
        apartment_id: integer
      }
    }
  ```
  Returns a `201` when the booking has been created. The response body looks like follows:
  ```JSON
    {
      data:
      {
        check_in: date
        check_out: date
        apartment_id: integer
        monthly_rent: integer
        deposit: integer
        utilities: integer
      }
    }
  ```

### Requirements
We have two different tasks here:
1. On one hand, we realized we're not checking availability before booking, so we need to update our API to return a `401` in case the apartment is unavailable for the selected dates.
2. Furthermore, as we're expanding, we've discovered that not all markets work in the same way. Our next market, "Mars", has different deposit and utilities conditions:
    * The deposit is a full monthly rent
    * Utilities are not a fixed amount and are linked to the apartments' square meters.

### What we look for
We've tried to create a simple test but, simultaneously, something that lets us know more about you. Some points that could help you:
* Feel free to change anything you think must/can be changed: variable names, code structure, etc.
* Add as many tests as you need/want. We're not looking for 100% test coverage.
* From now on, this is your project! You can change/refactor/delete whatever you think is needed. Just let us look how you like your production code


### Testing manually
  1. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`.
  2. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
